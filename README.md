The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process for developing software efficiently and reliably.
Common phases include:

Planning

Requirements Analysis

Design

Implementation (Coding)

Testing

Deployment

Maintenance / Monitoring

🔹 What does “SMART” mean?

SMART is a popular goal-setting acronym used in project management:

S – Specific

M – Measurable

A – Achievable (or Attainable)

R – Relevant

T – Time-bound

🔹 Putting it together: SMART SDLC

A SMART SDLC applies these principles to each phase of the development lifecycle, ensuring that every activity and deliverable is clearly defined and trackable.

SDLC Phase	SMART Application Example
Planning	Define specific objectives for the project — e.g., “Reduce customer response time by 30%.”
Requirements Analysis	Make requirements measurable — each user story or feature should have acceptance criteria.
Design	Ensure solutions are achievable given constraints — no over-engineering.
Implementation	Keep development goals relevant to user needs and business priorities.
Testing	Set time-bound testing cycles and clear quality metrics (e.g., <2% defect leakage).
Deployment & Maintenance	Establish measurable uptime goals (e.g., 99.9% availability within first month).
🔹 Why use SMART SDLC?

Promotes accountability and clarity.

Helps teams align software goals with business outcomes.

Improves measurability of progress and quality.

Encourages continuous improvement.
