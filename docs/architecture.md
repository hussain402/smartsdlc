# Architecture (Conceptual)

SmartSdlc is an AI-enhanced SDLC that interleaves model-driven insights into traditional software development stages:
- Requirements gathering (AI-assisted analytics)
- Design (architecture recommendations)
- Implementation (code scaffolding + tests)
- Testing (automated test generation + model-based fuzzing)
- Deployment (CI/CD with model monitoring)
- Monitoring & Feedback (telemetry + retraining loop)

The architecture diagram (assets/diagrams/architecture.png) illustrates components and data flows.
